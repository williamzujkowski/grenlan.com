                    <time datetime="2024-09-08">September 8, 2024</time>
                    <p>Debugging is like the final raid boss of coding. Except the boss is an ex-NSA cryptographer, and
                        instead of health points, they hit you with <em>NullPointerException</em> after <em>Segmentation
                            Fault</em>. But don't worry, just like a zero-day exploit in <strong>Hooligram</strong>'s
                        messaging service, debugging can be tackled with the right strategy‚Äîor in our case, the right
                        fuel:
                        pizza.</p>

                    <p>If you've ever hit that point where every line of code starts to feel like the punchline of a
                        cosmic
                        joke, it's time to check out the <a href="https://grenlan.com/pizza.html">Pizza Calculator for
                            IT
                            Engineers</a>. Why guess how much pizza you need when you could be focusing on figuring out
                        why
                        your containers are crashing? Whether you‚Äôre into <strong>Quantum Blockchain Pizza</strong>
                        (where
                        each slice is simultaneously valuable and worthless) or <strong>Auto-Scaling Cloud
                            Pizza</strong>
                        (where you have infinite slices, but still no clue what you‚Äôll be billed for), we‚Äôve got you
                        covered.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: After four hours of debugging, your code may still not work, but your
                        hunger will scale exponentially. That‚Äôs why we suggest upgrading to the <strong>Pizza Elite+
                            plan</strong>. It‚Äôs like horizontal scaling for your stomach.</p>

                    <p>Also, memo to the team: <strong>Wi-Fi Pineapple Pizza</strong> has been officially banned from
                        the
                        office. Why? Because the pineapple keeps hijacking toppings from everyone else. It‚Äôs like a
                        man-in-the-middle attack, but for your pizza.</p>

                    <p>So, next time debugging feels like a distributed denial of service on your brain, grab a slice,
                        fire
                        up the <a href="https://grenlan.com/pizza.html">Pizza Calculator</a>, and keep on coding. Just
                        remember, if all else fails, it‚Äôs always the intern‚Äôs fault. üçï</p>

                    <summary>The Origin of Grenlan</summary>
                    <time datetime="2024-08-12">August 12, 2024</time>
                    <p>In the summer of '99, I was just getting into <a
                            href="https://www.everquest.com/home">EverQuest</a>,
                        one
                        of the pioneering massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). It was an era when
                        dial-up
                        internet was the standard, and the sound of a modem connecting was the prelude to countless
                        adventures.
                        EverQuest offered an expansive, immersive world called Norrath, where thousands of players could
                        interact, embark on quests, and battle mythical creatures.</p>
                    <p>Choosing a character class was a pivotal decision in EverQuest, and I was drawn to the Bard.
                        Bards
                        were
                        versatile adventurers known for their musical prowess, able to play enchanting songs that could
                        boost
                        allies' abilities, debuff enemies, and even travel faster across the vast landscapes. They were
                        the
                        jack-of-all-trades, bringing a unique blend of support and combat skills to any group.</p>
                    <p>Needing a name for my new half-elf bard, I faced the typical writer's block. That's when I
                        remembered
                        the
                        Caesar cipher‚Äîa classic cryptographic technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a
                        certain
                        number of places down or up the alphabet. Picking numbers at random, I jumbled the letters of my
                        name
                        and created 'Grenlan'. It was unique, easy to remember, and perfectly suited for my bard's
                        adventures in
                        EverQuest. Check out my <a
                            href="https://ap.tritonguild.net/character.php?char=grenlan">character
                            profile</a>.</p>
                    <p>Since then, Grenlan has been my unique identifier in many MMOs and games, from <a
                            href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> to <a
                            href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. It's a name that carries the
                        spirit of
                        adventure and camaraderie.</p>
                    <p>One highlight of my EverQuest journey is my high-end raiding guild, <a
                            href="https://www.tritonguild.net/">Triton</a>. Sometimes, nostalgia hits, and I log in to
                        join
                        the
                        raids, reconnecting with old friends and reliving epic battles. Those were the days of long,
                        strategic
                        encounters and the thrill of downing a tough boss after many attempts, all while hoping the
                        connection
                        wouldn't drop!</p>
