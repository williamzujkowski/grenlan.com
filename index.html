                    <summary>Homelab Adventures: Scaling with Proxmox and ARM Devices</summary>
                    <time datetime="2024-09-14">September 14, 2024</time>
                    <p>Over the past year, my homelab has evolved from a simple setup to a robust environment that
                        mirrors enterprise-level infrastructure. I've been leveraging <a
                            href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" target="_blank">Proxmox VE</a> to orchestrate a fleet of
                        servers and devices, and it's been an incredible journey.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Backbone: Dell R910</strong></p>
                    <p>At the core of my homelab is a Dell R910 server, boasting 256GB of RAM and 48 threads. This
                        powerhouse serves as the primary node in my Proxmox cluster. Its processing capability allows me
                        to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) and containers without breaking a sweat.</p>

                    <p><strong>Expanding the Cluster</strong></p>
                    <p>To achieve high availability (HA) and establish a quorum, I've added two more Proxmox nodes.
                        These additional hosts ensure that if one node goes down, the others can take over seamlessly.
                        Setting up the cluster involved configuring shared storage, networking, and synchronization
                        between nodes. The process was educational and significantly improved the resilience of my
                        services.</p>

                    <p><strong>Networking with Ubiquiti</strong></p>
                    <p>My network infrastructure is powered by Ubiquiti equipment, including a firewall, router, switch,
                        and Wi-Fi 7 access points. The Ubiquiti ecosystem offers excellent performance and granular
                        control over network configurations. With the Unifi Controller, I can monitor traffic, set up
                        VLANs, and manage devices from a single interface.</p>

                    <p><strong>Embracing ARM Architecture</strong></p>
                    <p>In addition to x86 servers, I've incorporated ARM-based single-board computers (SBCs) into my
                        homelab:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://shop.zimaboard.com/products/zimablade-single-board-server-for-cyber-native"
                                target="_blank">Zimablades</a>: These compact yet powerful SBCs are perfect for
                            lightweight services and edge computing tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong>: The latest iteration offers improved performance, making it
                            suitable for a variety of applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other ARM-based SBCs</strong>: Running Debian 12, these devices are prepped for
                            automated rollout using Ansible and Docker.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Integrating ARM devices allows me to experiment with energy-efficient computing and distributed
                        workloads. They are particularly useful for hosting DNS servers, lightweight web services, and
                        IoT applications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Automation and Management</strong></p>
                    <p>To manage this diverse environment, I've implemented automation tools:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ansible</strong>: Automates the configuration and deployment of services across all
                            devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Docker</strong>: Containerizes applications for consistent deployment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proxmox Backup Server</strong>: Ensures regular backups of VMs and containers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Challenges and Learnings</strong></p>
                    <p>Setting up a homelab of this scale wasn't without challenges. Network configuration, storage
                        management, and compatibility issues required troubleshooting and research. However, overcoming
                        these hurdles has been rewarding and has deepened my understanding of system administration and
                        networking.</p>

                    <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
                    <p>I'm planning to explore Kubernetes for container orchestration and to further enhance the HA
                        capabilities of my homelab. Additionally, integrating monitoring tools like Prometheus and
                        Grafana is on the horizon to gain better insights into system performance.</p>

                    <p>If you're considering building or expanding your own homelab, I highly recommend diving in. It's
                        a fantastic way to learn, experiment, and have full control over your computing environment.

                    <summary>Debugging, Pizza, and Cyber Defense</summary>
                    <time datetime="2024-08-08">August 8, 2024</time>
                    <p>Debugging is the final raid boss of coding‚Äîexcept this boss is an ex-NSA cryptographer who wields
                        <em>NullPointerExceptions</em> and <em>Segmentation Faults</em> like they're going out of style.
                        But fear not! Just as a zero-day exploit can turn the tide in cyber defense, the right
                        strategy‚Äîand the right fuel‚Äîcan help you conquer any code beast. Enter: pizza.
                    </p>

                    <p>We've all reached that point where every line of code feels like a riddle wrapped in an enigma,
                        served with a side of sarcasm from the compiler. That's when you know it's time to consult the
                        <a href="https://grenlan.com/pizza.html" target="_blank">Pizza Calculator for IT Engineers</a>.
                        Why waste brainpower estimating pepperoni quantities when you could be figuring out why your
                        containers are mysteriously crashing?
                    </p>

                    <p>Whether you're a fan of <strong>Quantum Blockchain Pizza</strong> (each slice is simultaneously
                        delicious and nonexistent) or prefer the scalability of <strong>Auto-Scaling Cloud
                            Pizza</strong> (infinite slices, unpredictable billing), we've got your cravings covered.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: After four hours of debugging, your code might still be throwing
                        errors, but your hunger levels will have scaled exponentially. That's why we recommend upgrading
                        to the <strong>Pizza Elite+ plan</strong>. Think of it as horizontal scaling for your appetite.
                    </p>

                    <p>Also, a quick note to the team: The <strong>Wi-Fi Pineapple Pizza</strong> has been officially
                        banned from the office. For the uninitiated, a Wi-Fi Pineapple is a device used in penetration
                        testing to perform network audits‚Äîbut in our culinary context, the pineapple chunks kept
                        hijacking toppings from neighboring slices. It's like a man-in-the-middle attack but for your
                        pizza!</p>

                    <p>So next time debugging feels like a distributed denial-of-service attack on your sanity, grab a
                        slice, fire up the <a href="https://grenlan.com/pizza.html" target="_blank">Pizza
                            Calculator</a>, and keep coding. And remember, if all else fails, there's always more pizza.

                    <summary>The Origin of Grenlan</summary>
                    <time datetime="2024-07-12">July 12, 2024</time>
                    <p>Back in the summer of '99, I was diving headfirst into <a href="https://www.everquest.com/home"
                            target="_blank">EverQuest</a>, one of the pioneering MMORPGs that defined a generation of
                        online gaming. This was the era of dial-up connections, where the symphony of modem noises was
                        the soundtrack to our digital adventures. EverQuest opened up the expansive world of Norrath, a
                        place where thousands could quest, battle mythical creatures, and forge friendships.</p>

                    <p>Choosing a character class was no trivial matter, and I found myself drawn to the Bard. Bards in
                        EverQuest were the ultimate multi-taskers‚Äîmusical maestros who could boost allies, debuff foes,
                        and traverse the land with unmatched speed. They were the Swiss Army knife of classes, bringing
                        versatility and charm to any party.</p>

                    <p>But I hit a snag: what to name my half-elf bard? Inspiration struck when I recalled the Caesar
                        cipher‚Äîa simple yet classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a
                        certain number of places down or up the alphabet. I took the letters of my own name, applied a
                        few shifts, jumbled them around, and out came "Grenlan." It was unique, had a nice ring to it,
                        and perfectly suited my bard's adventures in Norrath. You can still check out my old <a
                            href="https://ap.tritonguild.net/character.php?char=grenlan" target="_blank">character
                            profile</a>.</p>

                    <p>Since then, "Grenlan" has become more than just a gaming alias‚Äîit's an extension of my digital
                        identity. From epic raids in <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_blank">World of
                            Warcraft</a> to tabletop campaigns in <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/"
                            target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, Grenlan has been there, embodying the spirit of
                        adventure and camaraderie.</p>

                    <p>One of the highlights of my gaming journey has been my time with the high-end raiding guild <a
                            href="https://www.tritonguild.net/" target="_blank">Triton</a>. Occasionally, nostalgia
                        calls, and I log back into EverQuest to join raids, reconnect with old friends, and relive those
                        epic battles. There's something magical about coordinating with a team to overcome challenges,
                        especially when everyone's on a shaky dial-up connection!</p>

                    <p>Creating "Grenlan" taught me that sometimes the best ideas come from blending different
                        passions‚Äîin this case, cryptography and gaming. It's a reminder of how far I've come since those
                        early days and how certain experiences leave a lasting imprint. If you've got a gaming alias or
                        a story behind your online persona, feel free to share it. I'd love to hear your tales!</p>

                    <summary>The Power of Python: Simplifying Complex Tasks</summary>
                    <time datetime="2024-06-15">June 15, 2024</time>
                    <p>Python has always been my go-to language for automating tasks and developing quick prototypes.
                        Its simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for both beginners and seasoned
                        developers.</p>
                    <p>Recently, I worked on a project that required parsing large XML files and extracting specific
                        data points. Here's a snippet of the code I used:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml(file_path):
    """
    Parses an XML file and extracts data from 'DataPoint' elements.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the XML file.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the extracted data.
    """
    try:
        # Load and parse the XML file
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        data = []

        # Iterate through all 'DataPoint' elements
        for element in root.findall('.//DataPoint'):
            data.append(element.text)

        return data

    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")
        return []
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("The specified XML file was not found.")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return []

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    xml_data = parse_xml("data.xml")
    if xml_data:
        print("Data extracted successfully:")
        for item in xml_data:
            print(item)
    else:
        print("No data extracted.")
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>In this code, I implemented graceful error handling to catch and report any parsing errors or
                        unexpected exceptions. This ensures that the program doesn't crash and provides meaningful
                        feedback to the user.</p>
                    <p>Adding thorough comments and error handling not only makes the code more robust but also easier
                        to maintain and understand. Always remember to handle exceptions that might occur during file
                        operations or data processing.</p>

                    <summary>Embracing the Command Line: Bash Scripts That Make Life Easier</summary>
                    <time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024</time>
                    <p>The command line is often seen as a relic from the past, but for me, it's an indispensable tool.
                        There's something empowering about typing commands and seeing immediate results, especially when
                        dealing with repetitive tasks.</p>

                    <p>One of my favorite bash scripts automates the backup of important files. Here's a simplified
                        version:</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-bash">
#!/bin/bash

# backup.sh - Backs up important files to a specified directory

SOURCE_DIR="$HOME/Documents"
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/Backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Copy files while preserving attributes
cp -a "$SOURCE_DIR/." "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Check if the copy was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup completed successfully."
else
    echo "Backup failed."
fi
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>This script creates a dated backup of my Documents folder. It includes error handling to check if
                        the copy operation was successful. Simple scripts like this can save time and ensure that
                        important data is preserved.</p>

                    <p>If you're new to the command line, I encourage you to explore. Start with basic commands, and
                        before you know it, you'll be scripting your own solutions!</p>

                    <summary>Homelab Adventures: Building a Proxmox Cluster and automating with Ansible</summary>
                    <time datetime="2023-08-01">April 1, 2024</time>
                    <p>As my interest in homelabs grew, I decided to take on a new challenge: building a Proxmox cluster
                        using a mix of x86 and ARM-based devices. The goal was to create a scalable, energy-efficient
                        setup that could handle various services and workloads.</p>

                    <p><strong>Setting Up the Cluster</strong></p>
                    <p>I started by installing Proxmox VE on two additional hosts to achieve a three-node cluster for
                        quorum and high availability (HA). The nodes communicate over a dedicated network, ensuring
                        minimal latency and improved performance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Integrating ARM Devices</strong></p>
                    <p>To complement the x86 servers, I incorporated ARM-based single-board computers:</p>

                        <li><a href="https://shop.zimaboard.com/products/zimablade-single-board-server-for-cyber-native"
                                target="_blank">Zimablades</a>: Ideal for lightweight container workloads and testing
                            environments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong>: Used for hosting IoT services and as a monitoring node.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These devices run Debian 12 and are configured for automated deployment using Ansible. While
                        Proxmox doesn't natively support ARM architecture for virtualization, the ARM devices are
                        integrated into the network and managed alongside the Proxmox cluster.</p>

                    <p><strong>Network Infrastructure</strong></p>
                    <p>The homelab network is powered by Ubiquiti equipment:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Firewall and Router</strong>: Secure and manage network traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Switch</strong>: Provides connectivity between all devices with VLAN support.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wi-Fi 7 Access Points</strong>: Offer high-speed wireless connectivity throughout
                            the house.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Unifi Controller allows centralized management of all network components, making it easier to
                        implement network policies and monitor performance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Automated Rollout</strong></p>
                    <p>Automation is key to managing a homelab efficiently. Using Ansible, I can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provision new servers and devices.</li>
                        <li>Deploy updates and patches.</li>
                        <li>Configure services consistently across all nodes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Docker is used extensively for containerization, enabling me to run applications in isolated
                        environments regardless of the underlying hardware.</p>

                    <p><strong>Benefits and Insights</strong></p>
                    <p>This project taught me a lot about mixed architecture environments, networking, and automation.
                        The combination of Proxmox and ARM devices provides a flexible platform for experimentation and
                        learning.</p>

                    <p>If you're interested in homelabs or considering building a cluster, don't hesitate to dive in.
                        There's a wealth of knowledge to gain, and the community is always willing to help.</p>
